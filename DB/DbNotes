Database Testing

		
		Schema:
		Data Mapping:
		Business Rules

		Stored Procedures, FUnctions, Triggers, Schemas
		Constraint, Indexes
		

		Database : Organized collection of databases.
		DBMS: collection of programs which allows user to organize, restore and retrive info from the db.


		Relationship in Database:
				1-1
				1-Many
				Many-Many

		Normalization: Process of removing redundant data
							Normal forms 

		SQL:
				DDL - Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate
				DML  - Insert, Update, Delete
				DCL  - Commit Rollback SavePoint


		Record: Collection of values of a specific entity
		Field:  A Area within record that is reserved for specific data
		Table: Colleciton of Record of specific type

		View is virtual Table

		Cursor is a temporary work area that stores the data, as well as the result set, occurred after manipulation of data retrieved. A cursor can hold only one row at a time.

		Locks:
				Shared
				Exclusive

		Index:
				Clustered index alters the table and re-order the way in which the records are stored in the table. Data retrieval is made faster by using the clustered index.

				A Non-clustered index does alter the records that are stored in the table but creates a completely different object within the table

		Trigger:
				A set of commands that automatically get executed when an event like Before Insert, After Insert, On Update, On Delete of row occurs in a table is called as Database trigger.
				


		Joins
				INNER JOIN/SIMPLE JOIN   : Common between two tables
											SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
											FROM table1 
											INNER JOIN table2
											ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

				LEFT/Left Outer JOIN   : everything from left table and common from both the table
											SELECT Student.NAME,StudentCourse.COURSE_ID 
											FROM Student
											LEFT JOIN StudentCourse 
											ON StudentCourse.ROLL_NO = Student.ROLL_NO;

				RIGHT/ Right Outer JOIN  : Everything from right table and common from both the table

											SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
											FROM table1 
											RIGHT JOIN table2
											ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;		
										
				FULL JOIN   :  Everthing from both the tables

											SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
											FROM table1 
											FULL JOIN table2
											ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

				CARTESIAN JOIN/CROSS JOIN : There is a join for each row of one table to every row of another table

											SELECT table1.column1 , table1.column2, table2.column1...
											FROM table1
											CROSS JOIN table2;

				SELF JOIN:  it is a join between two copies of the same table on some condition,  each row of the table is joined with itself and all other rows depending on some conditions

											SELECT a.coulmn1 , b.column2
											FROM table_name a, table_name b
											WHERE some_condition;
