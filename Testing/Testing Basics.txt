Software Testing Notes:

V Model
-----------------
Req Analysis        -   System Testing
High Level Design   -   Integration Testing
Low Level Design    -   Unit Testing
                  Coding


Software Development Testing Lifecycle - STLC
----------------------------------------
1. Req Analysis   -  Req Tracibility Matrix, Test Automation Feasibility
2. Test Planning  -  Test Plan & Test Strategy Doc , Effort Estimations
3. Test Development - Test Cases & Test Data
4. Test Env Setup   - Smoke Test, Env Setup
5. Test Execution   - Test Execution and Defect log
6. Test Cycle Closure - Test Closure Report


Unit Testing Techniques
--------------------------
1. Statement Coverage
2. Decision Coverage
3. Branch Coverage
4. Condition Coverage
5. Finite State Machine Coverage

System Testing :  Complete Integrated Product Testing, E2E Testing
--------------
Black Box :  External Working of the product, user perspective 
White Box :  Internal Code Testing


Sanity Vs Smoke
-----------------------
Smoke :  To Test Critical Functionality are working Fine after a new builds.
Sanity:  To Test new Functionality/Bugs are fixed in the build

Regression Testing
----------
To Test Existing Feature after new build/defect fixes.

Non Functional Testing
--------------
Performance Testing
Usability Testing
Load Testing
Security Testing
Stress Testing
Reliability Testing
Availibility Testing
