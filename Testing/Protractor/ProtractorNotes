Javascript is Synchronous; Single Thread Language: One Operation at a Time

To Make it Asynchrous: 
			Callback()
			Promises()
			Async() Await()

To Test Angular Applications:

Locators: 
			
		Find an element with a certain ng-model.
		// Note that at the moment, this is only supported for AngularJS apps.
		by.model('name')

		<span>{{person.name}}</span>
		<span ng-bind="person.email"></span>
			by.binding('bindingname')

		by.repeater("")
			Find elements inside an ng-repeat.  using row and column 
			ng-repeat


		element. all();
